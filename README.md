# The Anatomy of Data Platforms


This project is an attempt to give a complete analysis to all the data platforms that exists in [the "Big Data" landscape](https://451research.com/images/Marketing/dataplatformsmapoctober2014.pdf). Each data platform will be listed in succinct points in terms of strengths and weaknesses. References will also be given. 

Data platforms are categorized into 10 groups in the following, which are not mutually exclusive:
